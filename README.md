# Compound Solubility Prediction

EPFL Machine Learning Course, Autumn 2022 - Class Project 2

Team members: Malte Franke, Laura Mismetti, Giacomo Mossinelli

This repository contains the code for the prediction of solubility class of compounds. In particular are distinguished compounds with:
- High solubility: Nephelometry values lower than 50000
- Medium solubility: Nephelometry values between 50000 and 100000
- Low solubility: Nephelometry values higher than 100000
