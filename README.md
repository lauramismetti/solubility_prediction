Checklist:

General:
- [ ] Familiarize with literature

- [x] Create Kaggle accounts
- [x] Build a Kaggle group

- [ ] The data is heavily imbalanced. How do we deal with that? 

<br/><br/>

Code:
- [x] Write functionality to load the data

- [ ] Implement workflow for prediction on SMILES
- - [x] Convert SMILES to vector
- - [x] Implement ANN architecture
- - [x] Implement ANN training (regularization!)
- - [x] Implement ANN ensemble model
- - [x] Create predictions on competition data
- - [x] Submit predictions
- - [ ] Try out RandomForestClassifier (Sklearn)
